Enterprise Resource Planning is a 6th Semester Project taken up by Hemavathi C K, Kamraj R and Amit Nandan P, as a part of their MySql laboratory project requirements. ERP is a web application that allows enterprises and organisations, to dynamically handle their resources and employees and generates reports based on the employee. This miniature application of ERP caters to employee creation, project creation and bug reporting. More updates will be made soon! Thank you!
